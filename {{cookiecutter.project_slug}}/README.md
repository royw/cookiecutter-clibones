{{cookiecutter.project_name}}

This application used cookiecutter-clibones, a CLI application framework based on the argparse standard library 
with loguru logging.  Poetry and task are used for project management.

The architecture used is a Settings context manager that handles all the command line and config file argument 
definition, parsing, and validation.

The application's entry point is in {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/\_\_main\_\_.py
In main.py there several TODOs that you will need to visit and clear.

The application may be run:
* python3 -m {{cookiecutter.project_slug}} --help
* poetry run python3 -m {{cookiecutter.project_slug}} --help

So in general, for each command line argument you ought to:
* optionally add an argument group to the parser in Settings.add_arguments()
* add argument to the parser in Settings.add_arguments()
* optionally add validation to Settings.validate_arguments()

Refer to application_settings.py which implements help and logging as examples.

The __example_application() demonstrates using a GracefulInterruptHandler to capture ^C for a main loop.

Next take a look at main.main() which demonstrates the use of the Settings context manager.  

The Settings does have a few extra features including:
* config files are supported for any command arguments you want to persist.
* standard logging setup via command line arguments.
