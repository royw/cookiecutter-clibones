This is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template for creating a Command Line Interface (CLI) python application framework 
that uses [loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io) for logging.  
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [task](https://taskfile.dev/) are used for project management.

Please look at the {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/README.md for framework details.

To create a new application using this template:

* [Install cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

* Run:  cookiecutter https://github.com/royw/cookiecutter-clibones
